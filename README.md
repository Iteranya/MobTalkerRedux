## Description

This is my attempt at recreating the old Mob Talker Mod. I have zero experience in coding, but I have so much free time and GPT, so fuck it, let's see how far I can get with this.


## Planned Features
- Dialogue System, VN Style
- ~~Custom Scripting with Lua Integration~~ (Made a custom DSL and a Framework and an SDK Instead)
- Branching Dialogue
- Affection System
- 2D Sprite, like Visual Novel
- Quests System

## ToDo
- [x] Create The Dialogue Screen (It looks absolutely terrible, but screw it, it works. A custom GUI on Minecraft, that's like... The number 1 feature.)
- [x] Create Visual Novel Functionalities (The bare bones basic part I mean)
 - [x] Branching Path (One Dialogue Leads To Another)
 - [x] Sprite Changing (currently only support one character sprite)
 - [ ] Multi-Character Sprite (WIP)
 - [x] Figured this out, kinda
- [x] ~~Scripting with Lua Integration (It looks 10% better than raw json and I'm not masochistic enough to create a DSL)~~
- [x] Scripting requires an SDK I built [https://github.com/Iteranya/MobTalkerSDK]
- [x] Make Json FSM Parser in Java
- [x] Make the VN Engine in Java
- [x] Integrate everything into Dialogue Screen UI in minecraft
- [x] Make Debug Item for Debugging Stuff In Game (Working on this as of writing this)
- [ ] Create The Mob Profile GUI (Something that the old Mob Talker Mod doesn't have and I have a feeling I will learn why it doesn't have it)
- [ ] Saving Player Data and Data Management (I've made the classes required, bringing them together  is PIEN without an Ingame Debugging Tool)
- [ ] Custom Mob (Yeah, this goes later)
- [ ] Questing System (May or may not use a 3rd Party Mod integration for this)
