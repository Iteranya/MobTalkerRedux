# Mob Talker Redux

### YES, IF NO ONE ELSE IS GONNA DO IT, IMMA DO IT!!!

...

## Description

This is my attempt at recreating the old Mob Talker Mod. I have zero experience in coding, but I have so much free time and GPT, so fuck it, let's see how far I can get with this.


## Planned Features
- Dialogue System, VN Style 
- Custom Scripting with Lua Integration
- Branching Dialogue
- Affection System
- 2D Sprite, like Visual Novel
- Quests System
- Camera Mode (Later on)
- AI (Later On)
- Create a good 

## ToDo
- [x] Create The Dialogue Screen (It looks absolutely terrible, but screw it, it works. A custom GUI on Minecraft, that's like... The number 1 feature.)
- [x] Create Visual Novel Functionalities (The bare bones basic part I mean)
 - [x] Branching Path (One Dialogue Leads To Another)
 - [x] Sprite Changing (currently only support one character sprite)
 - [ ] Multi-Character Sprite (WIP)
 - [ ] Variables (I just thought this up)
- [x] Scripting with Lua Integration (It looks 10% better than raw json and I'm not masochistic enough to create a DSL)
 - [ ] Better Scripting With Lua (I can make it look better but you know what?? This one comes last)
- [ ] Make Debug Item for Debugging Stuff In Game (Working on this as of writing this)
- [ ] Create The Mob Profile GUI (Something that the old Mob Talker Mod doesn't have and I have a feeling I will learn why it doesn't have it)
- [ ] Saving Player Data and Data Management (I've made the classes required, bringing them together  is PIEN without an Ingame Debugging Tool)
- [ ] Custom Mob (Yeah, this goes later)
- [ ] Questing System (May or may not use a 3rd Party Mod integration for this)
